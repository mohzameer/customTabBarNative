# customTabBarNative

This is an basic implementation of how to use custom native tab bar to build a tab bar controller. We use the native bar as in this tutorial:
https://github.com/codepath/ios_guides/wiki/Creating-a-Custom-Tab-Bar
(it uses UIButtons embedded inside UIViews)

Advantages you gain over tab bar controller provided by Xcode:
1. Full control over the button action
2. Customizing the tab bar
3. Positioning
